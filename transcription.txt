Speaker 1: hey Max 
Speaker 2: how how you doing 
Speaker 1: fantastic 
Speaker 2: fantastic 
Speaker 1: I have to kind of apologize for being ridiculously happy 
Speaker 2: you mean you've been inexplicably happy your whole life 
Speaker 1: for the last maybe the last month or two in a consistent sort of manner and I attributed to various factors which we can go into are not so 
Speaker 2: thank you just spell it all out right now we can we can just shut this down and felt the inexplicable happy 
Speaker 1: I took a few weeks 
Speaker 2: what was happening over the few weeks 
Speaker 1: I can't remember and I'm more of the same I think it's clearly is the cumulative effect of a pandemic lockdown which for me has meant a tremendous limitation and repetition of the days which I find incredibly thrilling and interesting so the lack of options has opened up a new world of emotion for me I think that the intensity of not having too many options not seeing too many people walking working and reading and watching murder mysteries every night is an incredible thing and the cumulative effect of that is that if you can't find content in that well that's a shame so something happened with all of that 
Speaker 2: so something about the limitations of lockdown open things up just about removing distraction and bullshittin what's that about 
Speaker 1: living in New York what living anywhere living now there are a million things that you do and want to do and commit to doing with many many people in my life in my work but I think that everybody's suffered in the sense from the two muchness too much 
Speaker 2: too much everything 
Speaker 1: you know the first thing I think it was too much performing there were too many things going on and too many places to go to in too much running around which I 
Speaker 2: enjoyed on a stage or at a cocktail party 
Speaker 1: performing a lot of the time in in our way of interacting seeking approval being amusing being smart being something Alexa pressure and search for authenticity continues because if you have not that many options you better feel pretty good about what you have and so I like the sense of authenticity in a kind of snappier way it means having self-confidence and the courage of your convictions and you hold on to what you believe is real I hate myself a lot less during the pandemic I hope it lasts you know I wait I expect every morning to wake up and go like a well I hate myself again there you go 
Speaker 2: what did you hate 
Speaker 1: its sense of Shame continual sense of Shame and guilt 
Speaker 2: I think those two things are slightly distinct self-loathing and shame 
Speaker 1: I don't know hookah 
Speaker 2: I 
Speaker 1: beg to differ with my newfound self-confidence I'm sorry you're wrong that's really speaking to people who are over 70 that's a lot to overcome on some on many levels this sense of Shame and self-worth and doubt my mother always had the most important thing was time and my aunt said the most important thing was self-confidence and self-respect so that's a state that's a very delicate state to inhabit but once you get older you know the cliche of people saying what's really on their mind when they're older and all of that because times a-wastin so I better tell you what's on my mind is supposed to kind of dancing around the issue 
Speaker 2: what's your most important thing time is yours because that's all you 
Speaker 1: have and you don't have much of it if people don't bring up time and mortality I'll be stunned and what you do with your time of course I could say that the most important things are love and work and to love your work and to love the people that you're with is the XL you have so you have time love and work the end 
Speaker 2: that's the that's the math equation 
Speaker 1: and hopefully a few trips to Italy no pasta 
Speaker 2: can I see a little bit more about this would happen this fall sure you've let this incredible life you've done this incredible work you've been celebrated and teacher didn't and I wonder what changed what like what wasn't there when you were out in the world in a way that you you were not this fall like what wasn't there before that's 
Speaker 1: there now being with yourself and it's not that I wasn't with myself before but now I've really been with myself and everybody else has to so there's a common experience of the ground Falling Away and you find out what keeps you stable you find out what keeps you curious and happy and alive 
Speaker 2: is there another side of that coin of like being with yourself that's loneliness have you felt lonely 
Speaker 1: in this time absolutely I'm very I'm very sad a lot of the time that I'm not with somebody that I love I have my family and I love them but I'm not with a mate but that's offset by being absolutely jubilant that I don't have a mate and then I probably don't think too much don't think too much enters into the equation big time so it's all of those things 
Speaker 2: this whole thing it sounds like it's it's come from within you and get to know you to be this person who looks outside of herself constantly like a bitch really made your life noticing things and observing things and taking it in you spent your life observing and yet it feels like this quite incredible process if you've gone to feels very internal 
Speaker 1: working I'm working all the time painting what's going on around me writing about it so I have an outlet for my observations 
Speaker 2: well 
Speaker 1: the worst maybe a little bit dreamer and less tight if you want to speak about specifics of painting the desire to not paint to unpaint to leave things undone but not doing us a bad job whatever that definition is for me and that keeps changing 
Speaker 2: we what do you mean what do you mean what's a badger 
Speaker 1: bad job is a is a rushed painting that's not good when it's rushed I can't I don't like talkin about painting I don't like talkin about that process because it becomes too specific and I don't want to talk to you about how long it takes me to mix the color or change colors because I don't think that's interesting 
Speaker 2: cuz that qualifies like thinking too much on some level are you saying that you think you make things that are bad 
Speaker 1: bad bad everybody on Earth of course and without any question you cared up literally I can because it's paper and I throw it away and if you write something that you don't like you tear that up and you throw it away I mean there isn't a a person you look up to on the planet who doesn't do bad work some of the time 
Speaker 2: has it gotten easier to just tear it up and 
Speaker 1: forget about it probably I think that I'm enjoying throwing things away more than I used to I used to hold on to more things 
Speaker 2: grades 
Speaker 1: I'm not celebrating when things are bad when I think things are bad I'm not jubilant because I do I do want to do what I consider to be good work and whatever that means and so I I don't lose heart I was a little bit of heart but I do go on 
Speaker 2: I needed to perform or not feeling like you have to 
Speaker 1: perform definitely I think that this the minute you say I don't have to do anything other than just being myself and say what's on my mind and I may or may not be interesting to you that's fine

Speaker 1: actually I feel as if I am more childish than I ever was and one of the things that I've said about my life with whatever luck it was that I had a very happy childhood and I had a lot of self confidence and was a really thought that the world was a Rosie place and then question enter puberty and things get a little bit shaky in an adolescent some things get even shakier I'm an actual real life which is a blow but I feel as if I've returned very much to that state of being a seven or an eight year old I was a seven or an eight year old with money could be bad 
Speaker 2: do you feel like that's part of what's happened the last couple months like whatever this breakthrough is that has you feeling inexplicably happy do you think do you think that's connected 
Speaker 1: to that I'm really fortunate that I have the right elements in my life to make these leaves for these understandings that when I have is more than enough is the accumulation of experience in time it's layering one on top of another decades and work and people and sewing different errors but I had to my children when I was in my mid-30s and life with them accumulated the accrued value of life with them I meant that we've grown up together now I have grandchildren that richness is extraordinary topped with Express having an outlet for expressing myself it's like some kind of fantastic Triple Decker sandwich and club sandwich of Life shall we say I don't know what I'm missing I might be missing something really incredible but I don't know it so we'll see what happens 
Speaker 2: or helpful for me 
Speaker 1: to do a sandwich I'm kind of I'm really unhappy I mean the sandwich also has a lot of loss in it and I think that that's something that as to the experience of a fulfilled life that you've gone through some tragedies and the forces that keep the world a place that you want to inhabit reveal themselves 
Speaker 2: what do you mean 
Speaker 1: I guess the reasons you could save more simple way that there's a reason for being here there's no reason for being alive there's no religion there's no Superstition there is no anything that is going to say this is why you're here so everything that happens you have to find a reason to keep keep things going for whatever number of years you know that the explanation is not there so the only thing is to live 
Speaker 2: that's all while ridiculous to say what's better for slightly helpful and what I hear you saying is if there isn't some plan if there isn't some someone's going to come along and explain why you're here you have to do the work of figuring out why and the way that that happens not that you set out every day to answer that exact question but that over the course of a life if these things that provide meaning of themselves and some of them can be positive and some of them can be heartbreak but no one's going to tell you how to make the sandwich nobody can I think the thing that I'm trying to ask you about and trying to dig into which is admittedly hard to talk about inarticulate it's just I'm fascinated in the moments in which something revealed itself to you to be true moments in which you realized something and I think I'm interested in that because I don't know I don't understand how that works you know 
Speaker 1: well I don't think you realize that I think you feel it and that's what I say to you don't think too much time listening to you should listen to me because you can drive yourself Crazy by trying to figure it out as opposed to allowing your brain to just turn off and do go with your feelings and go with what makes you feel good well you're looking for answers 
Speaker 2: sure so are you up would you say that you are no longer looking for answers 
Speaker 1: I'm not looking for answers 
Speaker 2: anymore. 
Speaker 1: as I said it stopped last Thursday at 3 I stopped it's Tina but you know it's not a definitive state but I mean really again this is an age thing if you're still looking for answers and I don't mean nothing curious and not being attentive and all of those things but if you're still looking for answers oh well maybe you should think of something doing something else with that 
Speaker 2: time are you talking like a hypothetically or to me 
Speaker 1: personally don't know you know I don't know I'm saying that conceptually that don't get too obsessed with trying to find the answer because you'll find it anyway before one more 
Speaker 2: time my dad is is meant for the disease with me for years and years about like being on the dance floor and then being in the balcony and you know about like are you observing or a part of it where is that balance for you 
Speaker 1: it keeps changing 
Speaker 2: how so 
Speaker 1: you know where are you are you on the dance for you in the balcony there's so many different definitions of what that means you can be so out of it you can feel so excluded you can feel so far away from the center of action that you're on the upper upper upper balcony you're not just on the balcony you're on the roof you're in a different building completely then sometimes you feel you're just at the delightful Center and you have the desire to communicate can't be one thing you have to be all of those things otherwise how could you possibly function 
Speaker 2: can you think about times in your life in which you felt like you were in whatever definition of the balcony of the Dancefloor like does that 
Speaker 1: sure all the time that's one of the I think wonderful thinks of coming to a new country came right when I came when I was young child that my aspect my understanding of myself was that I was observing I like to be an observer of what was going around on around me and that that became a definition of kind of being a journalist I'm going to look at stuff and I'm going to report you so I gave myself a job it wasn't as if I was no I felt meaningless 
Speaker 2: like if you started as a as a young person in this role that we're observing felt comfortable and Reporting back felt comfortable what was your version of the dance floor 
Speaker 1: when I played Hopscotch in school when I when I was bike riding will actually notice if I'm if I'm cooking experiences out of the year I'm probably plotting the time when I was just doing something and not trying to be something so I think that play music so I played I didn't play well but reading was felt so real and natural having children 
Speaker 2: what about having children 
Speaker 1: that was to me a moment of now I know why I'm alive that was a Clarity that was complete and incontestable so why that happens not for me to know but it did 
Speaker 2: reason for being because of your kids I think that comes across in your work specifically like your your books written for kids you're so good at understanding and communicating with kids in ways that make it feel like you're you know really talking to them and then you take these at least surprising are these two beasts are surprising topics like you are a kids book about 9/11 how do you take these intense scary serious problems or moments are events and make them accessible to kids like how do you do that 
Speaker 1: if you love the people you're talking to and I happen to love the children the idea of children that I'm talking to you find a way to talk about anything there's not there's nothing that you can't talk about it if you do it with a certain kind of kindness and understanding of the limitations because children understand sorrow and children understand loss and fear very much so so if you pretend it doesn't exist then you're not being yourself with them doesn't mean you have to dwell on all of the Terrible Things So to write about 9/11 was a way of writing about that no matter what happens there's a resurrection and there is the future and there is the little things in your life that you can do so there's always a way to talk about that about anyting 
Speaker 2: to children but I don't think that's a easy-going 
Speaker 1: fireboat in that book about 9/11 there was an entree which was the story of this fire boat that ended up fighting the fires of 911 and there was a way of looking at the world in a bigger picture and to pick out the moments of heroism and the moments of hope you have to have that for children 
Speaker 2: have you had to have that for yourself to like in the moments in your own life of loss and sadness and is it the same muscle like finding a way through that of course 
Speaker 1: you have to we even though you don't think it's going to come and everything seems too overwhelming but of course the process of time helps you to find your balance 
Speaker 2: when you experience loss like that when you're dealing with sinus like that is is is the only thing time well 
Speaker 1: time is it really tremendous part of it but it's really is doing your work being with the people you love and allowing for time to do its work that's pretty much the way that I think if that process works as I say of course your intellect has a part of it but a lot of it is just Instinct whatever that is so I don't think you can you not only can you not set out to figure something out the revelations that you have you can't hold on to the revelations that just kind of a flow like a river flow and what your what you do with you except the fact that you're a river flow and that you're constantly you know this rock being rolled in the river and as you get older you understand the process and you have stability within that process
